• The first GUI shall have two Jbuttons (Start and Restart) and a JSlider. The Start button shall be used
to start the game. Once it’s pressed the second GUI displays and the game starts. Once the game ends,
the Restart button shall be used to start the game over. The JSlider shall be used for the player to
select the game difficulty: Easy (4 bubbles), Medium (5 bubbles), Hard (6 bubbles).
• The second GUI should contain the field where the game will be played.

• The program shall prompt the user to define the origin for each bubble by clicking the mouse on the JPanel. If the user defines an origin that will result in a bubble not fully contained within the JPanel’s dimensions, the program shall return an error and prompt the user to make another selection. Round 1 shall start as soon as the number of user selections equals the number of bubbles for the specified game difficulty.
